# Reflection:
# 1. Which mini-project felt most realistic, and why?
#The grocery store one felt the most realistic. Its like a really low level inventory software.
# 2. How do loops make data handling easier?
#Loops allow for you to go through multiple items quickly and with slight automation.
# 3. What did you find challenging about combining loops with collections?
#remembering all the different steps to unpacking at first was difficult.
# 4. One idea for how you could expand any of these mini-projects.
#For the grocery store one possibly adding a way for the user to just add the item to the order
#and then having it output the list of items and price.
