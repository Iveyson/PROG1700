# Reflection:
# 1. What bug or mistake caused your first infinite loop today?
# I did not have any infinite loops today but I did run into some issues importing a few python modules due to a file pathing error that went unresolved
# 2. How did you fix it?
# I did not fix it I went into the CLI and reset the file pathing for my userprofile and still couldn't use pip install
# 3. Which loop activity did you enjoy most, and why?
# I enjoyed the loop activity with the dice battle simulator since its the one I spent the most time on problem solving to attempt to get audio working
# 4. How might while loops be useful in a game or app youâ€™d build someday?
# while loops are useful for any counter based loops or repeating until conditions change. For example an atm machine is a good example.
