Reflection:
question1: What was the most challenging part of planning or coding?
           The most challenging part was getting the loop established and set up properly
question2: How did the trace table help identify errors before coding?
           The trace table allowed me to see some outcomes I needed to put if statements for such as if it was less then or equal to zero it would be an error.
question3: How would you explain your solution to a friend new to programming?
           I would explain to them in a way that is not about explaining the code but the logic I used to solve the problem.
           I established the possible variables and thought about what possible errors could happen if someone tried inputing numbers that dont make any sense. I then set up parameters that did not allow those people to input numbers that would cause those errors.
