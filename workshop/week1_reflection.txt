Setting up tools with VS code was very simple. Searching through the visual studio editor and grabbing the extensions
as well as linking our github repository was very easy and self explanitory to do. Pseudocode and flowcharts help before
coding to assist with your problem solving capability. A new thing I learned today was visio is a great tool to use
when making flowcharts.
